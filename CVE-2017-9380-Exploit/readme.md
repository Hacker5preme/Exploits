  - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9380

## ExploitDB:
  - pending submission
  
## Exploit Description:
The OpenEMR application allows users from all roles to upload files. However, the application does not whitelist only
certain type of files (e.g. PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX, etc). At the contary, any type of files can be uploaded to the
filesystem via the application. While OpenEMR recommends during the installation to restrict access to the repository
hosting uploaded files, unfortunately, such recommendations are too often ignored by users and can result in full
compromise of the web server and its data.
